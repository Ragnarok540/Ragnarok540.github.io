Hello there! Welcome to the first entry in this blog dedicated to all things related to Software Engineering. Today's topic, fittingly, is foundational to this area. 

The `SWEBOK`, or `Software Engineering Body of Knowledge` are the generally accepted principles that govern the practice of Software Engineering worldwide. It is published as a guide or technical report by the `IEEE Computer Society` and has become an `ISO` standard. In 2013 version 3 of the guide was published and can be [downloaded for free][swebok].

A total of 15 knowledge areas are found on the guide:

* __Software Requirements__ Elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of software requirements in the whole lifecylce of a software product.
* __Software Design__ The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and other characteristics of a system.
* __Software Consruction__ The creation of software through coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing and debugging.
* __Software Testing__ The verification that a program provides expected behaviors on a finite set of test cases.
* __Software Maintenance__ Planning for postdelivery operations, ensuring maintainability of code and documentation and logistics for transition activities.
* __Software Configuration Management__ The functional and physical characteristics of hardware and software that are documented and achieved in a software product.
* __Software Engineering Management__ Planning, coordinating, measuring, monitoring, controlling and reporting to ensure effective and efficient software delivery.
* __Software Engineering Process__ Requirements, design, construction, testing and configuration management processes for development, maintenance and operation of software.
* __Software Engineering Models and Methods__ Structures to make software engineering systematic, repeatable and success-oriented.
* __Software Quality__ Capability of software product to satisfy its requirements, for this to happen, the requirements must accurately represent the needs, wants and expectations of stakeholders.
* __Software Engineering Professional Practice__ Knowledge, skills and attitudes that software engineers must possess to practice software engineering in a professional, responsible and ethical manner.
* __Software Engineering Economics__ Aligning software technical decisions with the business goals of the organization, to ensure sustainably staying in business.
* __Computing Foundations__ All software engineers must have a good underderstanding of the computer and its underliying principles of hardware and software.
* __Mathematical Foundations__ Mathematics helps engineers understand the formal logic that computers and programs use to work. 
* __Engineering Foundations__ The application of systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to structures, machines, products, systems or procesess.

All the above summaries have been adapted or copied from the introduction section of each chapter in the `SWEBOK`.

It should be noted that the `SWEBOK` should be used as a guide and a reference, and that each of the knowledge areas described above have a vast ammount of published literature, and each topic has many subtopics that will be explored in future entries to this blog. All of these topics are also active areas of research.

Finally, it should also be noted that the `SWEBOK` makes no asumptions about the specifics of types of processors, operating systems, programming languages, development methodologies and practices, etc, because its objective is to be as general as possible.

That's about it for today's topic, if you would like to add or correct anything on this blog feel free to send an email (or even better, fork the [GitHub repository][repo] and make a pull request with your changes!). Peace.
