The `SWEBOK`, or `Software Engineering Body of Knowledge` are the generally accepted principles that govern the practice of Software Engineering worldwide. It is published as a guide or technical report by the `IEEE Computer Society` and has become an `ISO` standard. In 2013 version 3 of the guide was published and can be [downloaded for free][swebok].

A total of 15 knowledge areas are found on the guide:

* __Software Requirements__ `Elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of software requirements in the whole lifecylce of a software product.`
* __Software Design__ `The process of defining the architecture, components, interfaces and other characteristics of a system.`
* __Software Consruction__ `The creation of software through coding, verification, unit testing, integration testing and debugging.`
* __Software Testing__ `The verification that a program provides expected behaviors on a finite set of test cases.`

* __Software Maintenance__ `Planing for postdelivery operations, ensuring maintainability of code and documentation and logistics for transition activities.`

All the above summaries have been adapted or copied from the introduction section of each chapter in the `SWEBOK`.
